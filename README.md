Bike Price Prediction using Machine Learning
Welcome to the Bike Price Prediction project repository! This project focuses on predicting the prices of bikes using various machine learning techniques. The model aims to provide accurate estimations based on features such as brand, model year, mileage, engine capacity, and more.

Features
Data: The dataset used includes information on various bike attributes and their corresponding prices.
Models: Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) for predicting bike prices.
Evaluation: Metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score to assess model performance.
Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
models/: Code for different machine learning models implemented for bike price prediction.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
